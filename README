============================

Some clearing up
----------------------------
Clarification for everything that is to follow:
* Portalized is the name of the game engine
* Pseudoform is the name of the overall project, the idea and all media included
Any references to Pseudoform therefore also address Portalized because Portalized
is a necessary part of this project.
